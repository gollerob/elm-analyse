# Elm Analyse

A tool that allows you to analyse your [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) code, identify deficiencies and apply best practices.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

The following binaries should be available on the path:

```
node >=6
elm  0.18.x
elm-format (a version that is compatible with the source code you wish to analyse)
```

### Install

```
npm install -g elm-analyse
```

or if using `yarn`:

```
yarn global add elm-analyse
```

### Run

Change to the directory of Elm project you want to analyse and run `elm-analyse`.

Add the `-s` option for server mode. This will allow you to view results in your browser. To change the port use `-p XXXX`

### CLI Options

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `--help or -h`          | Print the help output. |
| `--serve or -s`         | Enable server mode. Disabled by default. |
| `--port or -p`          | The port on which the server should listen. Defaults to 3000 (`--port=3000`). |
| `--elm-format-path`     | Path to elm-format. Defaults to `elm-format`. |
| `--version` or `-v`     | Print version of software. |

## Supported Checks

| Check         | Description   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| DebugCrash | This check will look if `Debug.crash` is used within the code. You may not want to ship this to your end users. |
| DebugLog | This check will look if `Debug.log` is used within the code. This is nice for development, but you do not want to ship this code to package users or your endusers. |
| DropConcatOfLists | If you concatenate two lists (`[...] ++ [...]`), then you can merge them into one list. |
| DropConsOfItemAndList | If you cons an item to a literal list (`x :x [1, 2, 3]`), then you can just put the item into the list. |
| DuplicateImport | This check will look for imports that are defined twice. The Elm compiler will not fail on this, but it is better to merge these two imports into one. |
| ExposeAll | This check will look for modules that expose all their definitions. This is not a best practice. You want to be clear about the API that a module defines. |
| ImportAll | This check will look for imports that expose all functions from a module `(..)`. When other people read your code, it would be nice if the origin of a used function can be traced back to the providing module. |
| LineLengthExceeded | This check will mark files that contain lines that exceed over 150 characters (see 'check-specific-configuration' below to change the maximum line length). |
| MultiLineRecordFormatting | This check will if records in type aliases are formatted on multiple lines if the type alias has multiple fields. |
| NoTopLevelSignature | This check will look for function declarations without a signature. We want our readers to understand our code. Adding a signature is part of this. This check will **skip** definitions in let statements. |
| NoUncurriedPrefix | It's not needed to use an operator in prefix notation when you apply both arguments directly. This check will look for these kind of usages. |
| RedefineVariable | You should not redefine a variable in a new lexical scope. This is confusing and may lead to bugs. |
| UnnecessaryListConcat | You should not use `List.concat` to concatenate literal lists. Just join the lists together. |
| UnnecessaryParens | If you want parenthesis, then you might want to look into Lisp. It is good to know when you do not need them in Elm and this check will let you know. This check follows this [discussion](https://github.com/avh4/elm-format/issues/262) from `elm-format`. |
| UnusedImport | Imports that have no meaning should be removed. |
| UnusedImportAlias | Sometimes you define an alias for an import (`import Foo as F`), but it turns out you never use it. This check shows where you have unused import aliases. |
| UnusedImportedVariable | When a function is imported from a module but is unused, it is better to remove it. |
| UnusedPatternVariable | Variables in pattern matching that are unused should be replaced with `_` to avoid unnecessary noise. |
| UnusedTopLevel | Functions that are unused in a module and not exported are dead code. These should be removed. |
| UnusedTypeAlias | When you define a type alias, but you do not use it in any signature or expose it, then it is just filling up space. It is better to remove it. |
| UnusedVariable | Variables that are not used could be removed or marked as `_` to avoid unnecessary noise. |
| UseConsOverConcat | If you concatenate two lists, but the right hand side is a single element list, then you should use the cons operator. |

## Analysis Configuration

At this moment you can configure the checks that are included in the analysis by disabling or enabling them in a configuration file.

By default all checks are enabled. To disable checks, add an `elm-analyse.json` file to the root of the Elm project (beside `elm-package.json`).

An example configuration to disable the `UnusedTypeAlias` check is presented below.

```
{
  "checks" : {
    "UnusedTypeAlias": false
  }
}
```

> Note: In the future different checks will be configurable. Please make suggestions for these configurations via issues.

The keys in the `checks` configuration match the keys in the [Supported Checks](#supported-checks) section.

### Check Specific configuration

Check specific configuration can be added to the `elm-analyse.json` file in the following manner:

```
{
  ...
  "<CheckName>" : {
    "<property>": <value>
  },
  ...
}
```

The configurable options are:

| Check | Property | Description | Default value |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `LineLengthExceeded` | `threshold` | Defines the maximum line length | `150` |

### Ignore Paths

It is possible to exclude specific paths and files in the analysis with the following configuration in `elm-analyse.json`:

```
{
  ...
  "excludedPaths" : [
    "src/Vendor",
    "src/App/FileThatShouldNotBeInspected.elm"
  ],
  ...
}
```

## Scheduled Checks

See [#10](https://github.com/stil4m/elm-analyse/issues/10).

* Unnecessary `List.concat` when concatenating only fixed size lists.
* Functions where 'too much' happens.
* Function should be moved to another module for better encapsulation.
* Undocumented function that is exposed by module.
* Use alias for complex 'thing'. This can be done by inspecting signatures.
* Use point free notation where possible (`\_ -> b` to `always b` and `\x -> List.map f x` to `List.map f`).
* Determine untested code.
* Use multiline string instead of concatenated single line string.
* Use list concatenation instead of multiple `++`.
* Replace function with a function provided by `elm-lang/*` or `elm-community/*`.
* Magic numbers.

## Library Setup

The library is divided into the following main modules:

* `Analyser`: The `main` file that bootstraps the analysis and maintains the core state.
* `ASTUtil.*`: Utility functions for fact extraction on the AST.
* `Analyser.Checks.*`: All the checks that are performed.
* `Analyser.Fixes.*`: All the fixes that can be performed.
* `Analyser.Messages.*`: All messages that can be produced and the supporting functions.
* `Client.*`: Front-end code for running in 'server' mode.

The code that represents the Elm syntax and the parsing is supported by the [elm-syntax](github.com/stil4m/elm-syntax) package.
